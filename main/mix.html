      Graeme's a horticulturalist with likely many hidden aspirations which is characteristically validated in his recent absence.
      <br><br>
      It's probably been 8 years since I've seen him.
      <br><br>
      He told me about the time he spent in Japan. For days he would fish, revisiting the same spot time and time again. He fished every day and caught nothing in a 2 year span. He didn't seem bothered by it. In fact I think he found solace in reconnecting with nature, a quality that clearly hasn't left him since he was a kid, one that was curious in what the world had to offer. It's something that I commend him for, I find that it's tough to find people who have progressed in life naturally, who stay true to themselves.
      <br><br>
      Had me wondering: if Graeme made his prize catch, would he have released it?
      <br><br>
      If it came down to it, I'd throw it back in anyways. Just to go through all the motions again. I feel like he probably would've too.
